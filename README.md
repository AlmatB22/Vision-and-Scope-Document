## 1. Business Requirements

### 1.1.Background

After a drop in volunteer participation after the COVID-19 pandemic it has become abundantly
clear that a volunteer management system is needed. At this time manual volunteer assignment
takes two weeks which is unacceptable if the volunteer numbers are to return to a healthy
number. The majority of the assignment time is spent manually performing background checks
that take on average 10 days. However, with the automated checking system that will be ready in
time for system deployment this time would be reduced to only 48 hours. In addition to helping
seniors with daily tasks, a new system would allow volunteers to support students with tutoring
and coaching in extracurricular activities.

### 1.2.Business Opportunity

The Government has requested a system that will help find volunteers and help assign volunteers
to help senior people with their basic needs (because of the COVID-19 situation, there is a
shortage of volunteers). Such a system would save time for volunteers by sending information
that they put in the system to the police certificate-checking system. Not all volunteers know all
the processes and most of them are unsure how to apply for this certificate, so the system
acquires their information in the fastest and easiest manner and nothing else is required from
them. The Volunteer Management System will also save time for the government, as the manual
volunteer assignment will be operated automatically and since the police certification checking
process will take less time, the volunteer would be ready to help in a short period after verifying.
This will result in fast help for senior people who are in demand of help and increase the number
of volunteers.

### 1.3.Business Objectives and Success Criteria

**BO-1:** Reduce the volunteer assignment time to 30%,by reducing the time of the volunteer
application and sending information directly to the police certificate checking system

**BO-2:** Notify the user daily about the cases wherevolunteers have to help senior people for the
next week.

**BO-3:** The system should track 60% of all senior cases.

**SM-1:** The shortage of volunteers has to happen inless than two or two times per year


**SM-2:** According to estimation senior cases are starting from 10K to 15K and the system has to
track 60% of all these cases. The system should provide support to 85% of all tracked cases.

**SM-3:** The senior people should get help from volunteerswithin 3 days

### 1.4.Customer or Market Needs


A typical customer is either an elderly person or a school employee. A problem customer would
be an old person who is using the system to socialize with volunteers instead of legitimately
needing aid. An example of a customer would be Joane, a 78 year old ex-nurse who has no
living relatives and struggles with technology and arthritis. A student example would be Alfred, a
soccer coach who is hosting a under 12 tournament and needs volunteer referees.

### 1.5.Business Risks

_There are no business risks._

## 2. Vision of the Solution

### 2.1.Vision Statement

**For** senior people **who** need support from volunteers, **the** Volunteer Management System **is** an
information system **that** will provide automatic volunteerassignments for helping senior people
with making daily calls, provide wellness education and other daily things, and volunteer
application for fast and easy police certificate checks. **Unlike** the current manual volunteer
assignment and processes for volunteers that take a very long time (almost 10 days), **our system**
will save time for senior people, volunteers, and the government, solving the problem of shortage
of volunteers.


### 2.2.Major Features

Main Features(L1):
● Automated Volunteer Registration: Registering to be a volunteer is very simple with only
data entry done by volunteers. After the background check is completed they will be
notified of their new volunteer status.
● Automatic Volunteer Deployments: The volunteers' availability and skills are matched
with students or the elderly to help. They are then notified of where they need to be and
when.

Sub Features(L2)
● Automatic Police Background Check: The police station receives the volunteer data and
returns the confirmation that the person is allowed to volunteer.
● Scouts Out Future Volunteers: Volunteers are found through outreach and encouraged to
apply to help out their community.
● Sends Volunteers To Location: No further description needed.
● Notifies Mayoral Staff: Every day the mayoral staff is notified of the forecasted weekly.
volunteer needs so they are aware of the supply and demand for volunteers.
● Tracks Senior Cases: In order to predict the volunteer numbers needed the amount of
seniors in need of aide must be tracked

### 2.3. Assumptions and Dependencies

There are multiple assumptions that have to be made for the system to give the expected results.
For example, we need the police background check system which should be fully operational and
be able to return the results of the background checks within 48 hours. We would also need to
assume the people's engagement in beneficial activities like volunteering which will reduce the
crime rate in the city by 10% approximately. This will lead to the next assumption which is
possible sponsors like owners of local businesses will offer different promotions to the
volunteers as incentives. All of that is also very dependent on enough volunteers who can
support the senior people that will also have the minimum educational skills, pass the police
certificate, and be interested in participating. We have one main dependency which is the police
certificate check volunteers need to go through. We have to send all the data, and the government
is in charge of processing everything and returning a background check report.

## 3. Scope and Limitations

### 3.1. Scope of Initial Release

The main function of the Volunteer Management system is to add the number of volunteers and
connect them with senior people. The product is intended to give benefits to the senior people
by saving time, this is achieved by reducing the waiting period so that they will get the volunteer
services within three days. The system processes the registered volunteers' data in the system
and sends this information to the police certificate check system automatically, which results in a
shrinking time for the overall volunteer assignment process. The data processing and sending
information to the police certificate check is also a benefit for the volunteers, the reason is that
our system gathers volunteers’ data so that there is no need for them to go and apply for the
certificate manually. This feature will save a lot of time for the volunteer and attract them to
these activities.

**Scope of Subsequent Releases**

For the subsequent releases of the Volunteer Management System, other functions will be
added. One of these functions will be testing the volunteers for basic educational knowledge so
that they can not only do services for senior people but also teach and help kids with their
school and provide additional training and coaching for special cases.
